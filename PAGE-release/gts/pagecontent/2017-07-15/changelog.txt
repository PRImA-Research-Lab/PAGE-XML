*	Bug fix: The constraint for the confidence value of OCRed text was not 
	inclusive for 0.0 and 1.0 - it is now inclusive.

2013-07-15 

*	The format of polygons stored in <Coords> has been changed from 
	<Point> elements to a 'points' attribute. A polygon is now represented by a
	space separated list of points (x and y are comma separated). A list 
	requires at least two points (enforced by a regular expression constraint).
	Example: <Coords points="5,3 8,10 4,5"/>

*	All regions can now have nested sub-regions. Before this was limited to
	<FrameRegion> elements.

*	Frame regions have been removed from the schema. As a replacement
	<GraphicRegion type="frame"> can be used.

*	There are three new region types: <AdvertRegion>, <ChemRegion> and
	<MusicRegion> for advertisements, chemical formulas and musical notations.

*	The <PlainText> child element of <TextEquiv> is now optional.

*	Text recognition confidence has been introduced as new attribute of
	<TextEquiv>

*	Language can now be specified on text line and word level, in addition to
	region level. Therefore <TextLine> elements have a new attribute
	'primaryLanguage' and <Word> elements have a new attribute 'language'.
	Values set for child elements are interpreted to override values of parent
	elements.

*	The elements <Layer>, <UnorderedGroup> and <OrderedGroup> have a new attribute
	'caption'.

*	Text lines can now have a <Baseline> child element. The baseline is a multi-
	segment line represented by a list of points ('points' attribute with the same
	format and constraints as polygon points).

*	The <Page> element has a new attribute 'type'.

*	The <Page> element has a new child element <AlternativeImage> (0..*) with
	attributes 'filename' and 'comments' (to be used for bi-level image etc.).

*	New attributes 'custom' and 'comments' for various elements. The former is
	intended for machine use (custom types for instance). The latter is intended
	for human use (context information, remarks etc.).

*	Extended constraint for 'type' attribute of <GraphicRegion> element.
	Added: 'decoration', 'barcode' and 'frame'.

*	Extended constraint for 'type' attribute of <TextRegion> element.
	Added: 'endnote' and 'other'.

*	Extended constraint for 'primaryLanguage' and 'secondaryLanguage' attributes 
	of <TextRegion> element. Now conform to ISO standard.

*	Extended constraint for colour attributes.
	Added: 'other'.

*	Extended constraint for 'colourDepth' attribute.
	Added: 'other'.
	
*	The elements <TextRegion>, <TextLine>, <Word> and <Glyph> have a new child 
	element <Textstyle> with attributes 'fontFamily', 'serif', 'monospace', 
	'fontSize', 'kerning', 'textColour', 'bgColour', 'reverseVideo', 'bold',
	'italic', 'underlined', 'subscript', 'superscript', 'strikethrough',
	'smallCaps', 'letterSpaced'. Any attributes of <TextRegion> that appear
	in this list have been removed (moved to <TextStyle>).
	Values set for child text objects are interpreted to override values of parent
	text objects.

*	New attribute 'production' for elements <TextRegion>, <TextLine>, <Word> and 
	<Glyph>.
	Values set for child text objects are interpreted to override values of parent
	text objects.

*	New child element <Relations> for <Page> element to model relations between
	layout objects (e.g. drop-capital - paragraph, image - caption). Single
	relations are represented by <Relation> elements with attributes 'type',
	'custom' and 'comments' as well as two <RegionRef> child elements.

*	New attributes for <Page> element (take priority over region-level values, 
	if defined):
	- "primaryLangage"
	- “secondaryLanguage”
	- “primaryScript”
	- “secondaryScript”
	- “readingDirection”
	- “textLineOrder” (see below)

*	New attribute "externalRef" for <Metadata> element. Generic string that 
	can point to an external document / resource

*	Changed constraints for "primaryScript" and "seconddaryScript" (<Page>, 
	<TextRegion>, ...). 
	Now based on ISO 15924 http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html
	Requires migration from 'Chinese-Traditional' and 'Chinese-Simplified' 
	to Han (Traditional variant) and Han (Simplified variant)

*	New attribute "textLineOrder" for <Page> and <TextRegion> elements. 
	Represents the inner-block order of text lines (in addition to “readingDirection” 
	which is the inner-text line order of words and characters)
	- String, optional
	- Constraints: top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, left-to-right, right-to-left

*	New attribute "xHeight" for <TextStyle>. “The x-height or corpus size 
	refers to the distance between the baseline and the mean line of 
	lower-case letters in a typeface” 
	- Integer, optional, Unit: pixel

*	New attribute "dataType" for <TextEquiv>. Repreents type of text content 
	(observed or expected).
	- String, optional
	- Constraints: xsd:decimal, xsd:float, xsd:integer, xsd:boolean, xsd:date, 
	  xsd:time, xsd:dateTime,xsd:string,other

*	New attribute "dataTypeDetails" for <TextEquiv>. Refinement for “dataType”, 
	e.g. a regular expression
	- String, optional

*	Changes for usage of <TextEquiv> element (sub-element of text region, text line, 
	word and glyph):
	- Can now occur multiple times to reflect OCR / text variants
	- Additional “index” attribute can be used to order the variants 
	  (lowest index is used as main text content)
	- Additional “comments” attribute (explanations, e.g. if different OCRs are used 
	  or an annotated version of the text content is entered)
	- “conf” (OCR confidence) is attached to “TextEquiv” as before

*	Added attributes "primaryScript" and "secondaryScript" to <TextLine> and <Word>

*	New attribute "script" for <Glyph> element. Same constraints as "primaryScript" 
	for <TextRegion>


2017-07-15

*	Graphemes: New level below glyphs for compound characters. Includes new elements:
	- Graphemes (container)
	- Grapheme (with Coords)
	- GraphemeGroup (with child Grapheme and/or NonPrintingChar elements)
	- NonPrintingChar
	All with TextEquiv and following attributes:
	- ID
	- ligature
	- charType (character type - "base" or "combining")
	- custom
	- comments

*	User-defined attributes
	- New UserDefined element for Page, Metadata, regions, TextLine, Word, Glyph, and
	  reading order groups
	- UserAttribute elements as child elements, with attributes:
	  - name (String)
	  - description (String)
	  - type (String, one of xsd:string, xsd:integer, xsd:float, xsd:boolean)
	  - value (String)

*	New Roles element for regions. Container for roles that nested regions take on in 
	context of a parent region.
	- TableCellRole child element (e.g. for nested regions of a table region); attributes:
	    - rowIndex, columnIndex - Position of the upper left corner of the cell in the table
	    - rowSpan, colSpan - Height / width of the cell in the table

*	Extended text type constraint to include "list-label" for text regions that are list item
	labels (numbers or bullets)
	
*	New attributes for reading order groups:
	- type (string, one of: div, paragraph, list, list-item, figure, article, other)
	- custom (string)
	- comments (string)
	- regionRef (IDREF) - Optional link to a region. Can be used for parent regions that 
						  contain nested regions. The parent region can double as reading 
						  order group. Only nested regions should be allowed as group members.
	
*	New boolean attribute "continuation" for regions and reading order groups, indicating that 
	an object is the continuation of another object in the previous column or page, for example

*	New string attributes "textColourRgb" and "bgColourRgb" for TextStyle elements. 
	Alternative to named colours. Format is RGB encoded (red value) + (256 x green value) + (65536 x blue value).
